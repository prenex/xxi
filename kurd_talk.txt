You: Hello

Stranger: hey

You: What are politics around there?

Stranger: well

Stranger: you can say

Stranger: looking for freedom

You: hmm

You: are your people opressed?

Stranger: highly oppressed and suppresse

You: sad to hear

You: where are you from?

Stranger: kurdistan

Stranger: and you

You: oh

You: I know you are not even having a sovereign country :-(

You: I am from Hungary

Stranger: yes true

You: your people are cut into several neighboring countries isn't it?

You: all minority everywhere

Stranger: exactly

You: but a big population otherwise

You: or measurable

You: I mean if you add all up

Stranger: man, wer're more than 50 million people

You: wow

Stranger: at least

You: man there should be some country that you to be having proper control over...

Stranger: we're trying our best

Stranger: but big politics are really complicated

You: yes....

You: We are 15 million Hungarians

You: 10 million in Hungary

You: other 5 in all surrounding countries which once was Hungarian land

You: at least partially relate - but at least we have Hungary

Stranger: yeah same to us but we're on a larger scale

Stranger: countries like turkey, iran, iraq. and syria are involved

You: and in Carpathia they prohibit Hungarian speech in school now

You: I guess many-many similar things happen there in your case

Stranger: even worse

You: yeah firearms involved

You: even as I know

Stranger: we are the only nation in the middle east that demands peace but no one is listening

Stranger: the world cares for money and interests more than humans and peace

You: Though situation. Turkey alone is a middle-to-large power, others are middle and big powers also have various bullshit agendas on their own

You: who helped you most you feel?

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: mostly US

You: hmmm

You: I usually dislike US because they keep going into our own matters on wrong side for us - but this not mean they cannot be ok for others

Stranger: believe me you can't expect anything of them

You: ah that I know for sure

You: in 1956

You: we rise up against soviet union

You: won over their local forces - which was big victory

You: they had a big line of tanks originally aiming to go towards Suez

You: to make it russian owned - they had much money in that people say

You: anyways

You: we all asked USA all day

You: they said they will help

You: in the back they agreed they get suez

You: will not interwene here

You: and tanks who would go there all went to us

You: and crush all our revold bloodily

Stranger: so sad to know this fact

You: Suez was big win for west

You: we would be small win

Stranger: things like that happened to us many times

Stranger: yeah no one really cares for humans and their rights

Stranger: those are just some fake propagandas

You: yes the bigger an empire is, the bigger their interests driven - sometimes you can fell out good from deals

You: but one needs to be really cautious

Stranger: agree

Stranger: but i still very sorry for happended to you back in 1956

You: actually it was not without a fruit

You: commies did not rule as before

You: they knew if they go too far there is big uprising

You: so despite we lost it did win something

You: your cause is just and right I say too

You: you have a nation, every nation in my view deserves country and self governance

Stranger: let me tell what they say

Stranger: they say that kurds don't deserve an independent country because if they did their own countries will get affected

Stranger: we say to them, who the hell cares for your country i just want my land and solve you own problem on your own

Stranger: it is our land

Stranger: man for thousands of years

You: And what I say is that your nation is a pretty big nation in population - I think is pretty old - and have no country? Not fair.

You: isn't you related to Medes?

Stranger: it is an ancient empire of kurds

You: hm

Stranger: and before it the mitanni empire

Stranger: and before them the old kurds: the hurrians and the guti

You: we have these in our chronicles actually - like in Chronicle pictum the one with the beautiful images

Stranger: a kingdom called kurda existed 22 centuries BC

You: maybe not in the one with images... we have like 20-30 chronicles and 4-5 chronicle families of olden times

You: in commie times all this was termed "likely bullshit"

Stranger: really]

You: but mostly for political reasons

Stranger: can you have any opportunity to share even a one with me please

You: pfff I did not see them online much

You: usually people buy them properly

Stranger: I see

You: friend has some

You: I will want to buy some of these too

You: good old tales

You: I only have Book of myths so far

You: but that is much much before

Stranger: interesting

You: but not much is said from Medes and such

You: like that Atilla went in the clothing of Medes

You: and such

You: I just remember hearing the term

Stranger: wow i don't what Atilla is

You: and on history classes we learned that Kurds are realted to Medes and that is all

You: you don't know him?

You: Atilla the Hun

Stranger: no

You: he defeat roman empire

Stranger: first to hear that

Stranger: lol

Stranger: when was that

You: 400s?

You: not sure are the dates from that times actually - despite what historians teach

You: but 400 something they did war against Rome

Stranger: alrighr

You: Huns had big empire stretching from Europe to China on the steppes

You: but many other nations were part of that - mostly was an alliance

You: Huns lead it

You: some Turkish people also fought there on our side - that is why they all the time say on football matches they are sons of Atilla and such, but they are not related to Huns

You: I mean... of course if they feel to be okay, but only because some turk tribes went along, that was not who organized this

You: our myths say Hunor and Magor were two sons of Nimrod originally Magor are fathers of Magyars and Hunor father of Huns. After Huns win over Rome and Atilla got assasinated Goths made a brother rivalry among Huns and they got defeated so they went back to Magyars people

You: this was on steppes, before this they came to be both there coming up through Caucasus and the other side of the caspian sea

You: northwise

You: and there they breed with Alan tribes

You: that is how Huns and Magyars came

You: but after Huns defeated, their remaining people fled to us and reunite

You: and later we came back together to todays Hungary

You: we still found some "Székely" or "Scythian" people there who Huns left behind

You: and could speak with them

You: these people - around 3 million - still speak some different but very understandable more ancient Hungarian

You: and live in Transylvania still

You: after more than 1500 years

You: now not anymore Hungary

You: but of course they are our nation and we feel belonging to each

You: then we live through medieval times and modern times and here we are

You: came back to where Atilla's palace was and still here ;-)

You: ^^I mean this is what Chronicle says

You: 4-5 variants say it 4-5 similar ways

You: book of myths also similar but there some names differ

You: that is collected from tales not written by historians in medieval times

Stranger: by the way

You: yes?

Stranger: think that you mentioned nimrod

Stranger: ?

You: yes

Stranger: wasn't he a king

You: yes

You: accordign to our books he was there building tower of babel

You: and first king

Stranger: nimrod is the one that got killed by the hands of kawa

Stranger: kawa hasinkar (in kurdish): kawa the blacksmith

You: that is interesting

You: we call it "Kovács"

You: and "Kova" is the stone you make fire with

Stranger: wait wait

You: I mean "Kovács" means smith in my language

You: listening - just wanted to add

Stranger: no i just wanted you to tell me what kovac means

Stranger: smith or fire

Stranger: because

You: smith is kovacs

You: kova is the stone you make fire

You: but the ending "-ás" means "with something"

Stranger: when kawa killed him he went up to the top of a mountain and fired a flaim

You: like "the man with the stones to make fire with" or "work with fire" you understand I guess

You: hmm

Stranger: declairing the victory

Stranger: that's why the kurds celebrating Newtoz every year

Stranger: and the flame is our symbol in newroz

You: what newroz means?

Stranger: that's very interesting

Stranger: newroz in kurdish means the new day

You: because Nimrod also we call "Nemere" and "Nemrót"

Stranger: nimrod was also called "zahak" or "al zahak" according to some people

You: hmmm

You: I never hear that - or if did I did not pay attention to it, but good information

You: but then in your mythology Nimrod was negative figure?

You: in many it is

You: in ours it is our forefather and is positive

Stranger: the worst man on the earth lol

You: haha

You: I was not there to judge but I see

You: do you have info why it was that?

Stranger: do you want to hear what we think of him

You: why not? these events were ages ago

You: btw what is interesting is that "Book of myths" also have a clearly smith character

You: brother of "Szépmező Szárnya"

You: Szépmező Szárnya was smallest he was the herdsmen
Széptüzek lángja was his brother - he was the smith
and Jószép fúvása was also borther - I can't remember now what he did

You: but these names tell what they do

You: like "széptüzek lángja" mean "flame of the nice fires"

You: because he is smith

You: so maybe these are not names you know

You: and this is not from chronicles but from the myths

Stranger: according to kurds nimrod was very rich, and he has killed a lot of kids and young men. and we believe that when he killed the children of kawa or some people say that nimrod killed all of his kids except kawa. but anyways kawa had started a Revolution against him and after he killed him he fired the flame from the mountain and announced a new day for the people who would become later kurds. i think all of that happened during the median empire....

Stranger: by the way in the kurdish date we are in 2721

You: oh, you have your calendaring system?

You: that is nice

Stranger: yeah of course

Stranger: we are an ancient nation brother

You: we have old alphabet, but not calendaring system anymore

Stranger: yeah we also have our own alphabet

You: deep knowledge of stars we had though

You: oh

Stranger: awesome

You: hmm alphabet not looking similar to ours but I only look at it really shallowly

Stranger: we don't speak the ancient language of medes, mitanni, guti, hurrians, but we still recognize a lot of their words more than any other people and nations

You: oh

You: can you say some?

Stranger: like what

You: I mean old words if you know

You: our language also very-very old

Stranger: yeah just let me check

You: and I wonder what is year 0 in your calendaring

You: likely some big moment

Stranger: that was newroz

Stranger: 700 BC the new day started when kawa fired the flame

You: oh thanks for telling

Stranger: i

Stranger: i'm still gathering some words for you

You: our chronicle not telling when Nimrod/Nemere lived

Stranger: while belive that it was 2721 years ago

You: hmmm

You: for first sight sounds a bit short for the amount of events - but I never read them in that way things would happen around that time so who knows

You: certainly I will try to see

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: man, it is very difficult

Stranger: i'm still looking for some words

You: oh :-(

Stranger: i have a lot but i don't remember their meanings

Stranger: by the way

Stranger: do you know zaradasht or avista

You: you guys should keep knowing those well - Humanity would lose who knows what relevant informations without you guys for the words too ;-)

You: I do not know what zaradasht is

Stranger: yeah we have people know a lot even i know but i forget

You: we have city named "Zára" though

You: never mind not sure it counts for this case

Stranger: what about zaraost

You: what is zaradasht?

You: zarathrustra I heard of

You: but not from myths

Stranger: zaraoster

You: That is same person isn't it?

Stranger: he is the same as zaradesht

Stranger: yes the kurdish prophet

Stranger: zaradashti is the kurds' ancient religion

Stranger: centuries before christ

You: That religion also have a lot of things around fire if I know it well

Stranger: it is still alive till this day

Stranger: in kurdistan

Stranger: yes

Stranger: yes fire is very special for them

Stranger: but also the water and air and soil

Stranger: the four elements of nature

Stranger: are very holy or sacred things for them

Stranger: nice to hear that some other people know about that

You: Actually the wise old man I used to go to his talks to

You: I mean I go there and listen

You: he sometimes touch the topic of Zoroaster

You: when there are connections

Stranger: interesting

You: he is a professor of "art history"

You: and knows all the chronicles and stuff

Stranger: yes zaradasht was very wise

You: also all folk tales he knows

Stranger: great perosn he is, I belive

You: and many times message in tales and symbolism has either astrology in it

You: or elements and such

Stranger: may god bless him

You: I really hope God does... he is over 70 now

You: he know all stuff

You: talked to a real Táltos people when they were around

You: those are spiritual leaders in my culture originally

You: for simplicity people say "its like shaman" but is not

You: that is like offending haha

You: because it is not at all, but when talking to western people that is closest they can imagine

Stranger: I see

You: old religion had this title

You: some of our kings had it too

Stranger: actually I roughly understand

Stranger: can you explain more what is taltos and shaman because i don't know any of them

You: fire they also respect, but it is not like they think there are multiple God or animalist

You: also one thing is that fire in my language is "tűz"

You: "tiszta" however means "clean"

Stranger: in mine is "Agir"

You: and "tisztelet" means "respect"

You: ohh!

You: Ég!

You: that also is fire

Stranger: Wow!!!!!!!!!!

You: tűz is "the fire"

You: when we say "ég" that means it is a verb

Stranger: you only have to add (I and R)

You: yes

You: surely related

Stranger: I believe that we may have a lot of similar words

You: we have this own version of the Christian creation of the world haha

You: where it is more highlighted that "kezdetben vala az ég"

You: in all languages this only means heaven

You: but for us it both means this fire as I mention

You: and heaven too

Stranger: haha

You: and this version that we do not know where is it from, just collected in medieval times say we say it like this because we know fire was first of the elements

Stranger: how does it pronounce

Stranger: we believe that water is the first element :)

You: like how people pronounce the Aegeian sea

You: Ég

You: but in my language vowels not count that much

You: they are putting in the emotions

You: vowels make the meaning

Stranger: nice

You: there was time people in old writing alphabet can leave out vowels anytime when out of spce

Stranger: cooool

You: they also for the same reason write together letters whenever fit for the shape

You: I will look this up, just a moment

You: some table

Stranger: just like when i annotate some notes in the lectures lmao

You: wait I learned it from the old man

You: just need to find it

You: have it somewhere

You: vowels are grouped into groups

You: if you change while still keep being in a group

You: you usually get an other Hungarian word

You: with either same or similar meaning

Stranger: How..

You: sometimes works with other languages I meet with too

You: but not always

You: it is like we have this property that what sounds close when it comes how you make a sound in your mouth

You: for consonants

You: there will be related meaning

Stranger: i'm sorry but i can't still get it

You: (B - P) - (V - F): "Pöfögős" hangkategória (A)

D - T - Ty: "Felpattanós" hangkategória (B)

J - R - L - Ly - "Nyelvmozgós" hangkategória

(K - H) - (G - Gy) - (Dzs): "Köhögős" hangkategória (C)(D)

N - M - Ny: "Letapadós" hangkategória (orrhangok) (E)

(S - Sz - Z - Zs) - (Cs - C): "Sziszegős" hangkategória (F)

X - Y - Q - W: "Idegen" hangkategória (G) - this last is foreign symbol

You: found it finally

Stranger: alright

You: I give you an example

You: "Gyerek" = this means kid here

You: but "Kölyök" also means kid

You: a bit different it feels - like maybe more naughty of more young

You: but same

You: then we remove the vowels usually

You: in mind

You: Gy-R-K remains

You: in the other it is K-Ly-K

You: then I see all of them fit in the same pronounciation group

You: like K-H-G-Gy

You: and R-L-Ly-J

You: please mind Gy and Ly is a single consonant just poor latin alphabet has no letter for it

You: we have in ours

You: it is between an L and a Y if you think in english

You: and "J" we pronounce Y anyways...

You: you do not need to fully understand how we pronounce

You: just that these are grouped on bases of similar feeling when you make the sound

You: and then if something groups together you pretty much "free to change it"

You: so in dialects people did

Stranger: it is more clear now

You: but anyways

You: knowing this for me it is pretty 99% sure Ég and your word is same

You: because when we apply this this is how we think: if meaning and the consonant of the word root are in same group

You: then likely not random that it fits

You: not in all cases of course I guess and not with all language

You: but for me it feels like such in that case for example

Stranger: yeah true

Stranger: but

Stranger: can i ask you a questoin?

You: yes

Stranger: do you have two vowels next to each other in one word

You: hmmm

You: need to think

Stranger: like two vowels, one after the other

Stranger: like eat in english

Stranger: because

You: when something is "long vowel" we have different sign for it be long

You: but hard to find when different vowels

You: likely if I think enough I can find but does not came to my mind? or maybe there is none?

Stranger: in kurdish two vowels can never be neighbios

You: I see

Stranger: it is impossible

You: I am not sure if that is a rule here, but certainly I cannot even think of a word that is like that

You: also it usually sounds not good

Stranger: instead

Stranger: we add between them one of this (w - h - y)

Stranger: also we have some words they are written with the same letters but they pronounce differently

Stranger: like: (tiri)

Stranger: tiri can defined as grape and as a tail of an animal

You: I think I can forge a word like this: Óisten - but then my mouth tries to say Ó Isten separately pretty much despite I can write it down

You: it means "oldgod"

You: but people not use this word - just that we can made up new words according to rules when needed and everyone would understand what I mean by this

You: hmmm

Stranger: cool

You: but do you pronounce it differently or only the meaning is different of a same word?

Stranger: no

Stranger: the (T) when you want to indicate to grape it is light, but when you mean a tail you have to say very strongly literally

You: hmm

Stranger: did you get it

You: I think I kind of

You: is it always the strenght that change in these cases or other ways also in pronounciation?

You: or maybe I ask the wrong question... what was interesting is that both stil have some connection to the "T" sound just differently saying that sound

You: or sometimes completely differing?

You: interesting property in any ways though!

Stranger: no, cases like "Tiri" are very rare because in kurdish every letter has its own pronunciation, just like in Russian maybe or korean, i mean anything you write you will read as it's written

You: and in Hungarian haha

Stranger: Wow

You: you look at a letter and it is what it is

Stranger: lol

You: not like french - not even english

Stranger: yes exactlyyyyyy

You: I think original and old languages do it like this

Stranger: yes most of them were like that

You: in English when they differ many times it is some kind of mutation of a word and writing systems

Stranger: like the old egyptian and Sumerian

You: just like when I in my language but latin letters must use "Ly" - thank God there is no confusion because Y cannot be used alone anyways

You: as a letter

You: not as sound

You: yes

Stranger: wait what

Stranger: if y is the same to my language, then y always must be followed by another letter

You: haahahaha

Stranger: and it can't be written alone as well

Stranger: for example ya yo yi ye yu and others

You: what is yo?

Stranger: this is and example

You: we use letter "j" for the "y" sound

You: oh ok

You: just "jó" means good here

Stranger: you didn't get it correctly

Stranger: what i'm just saying is that we have some letters they must be followed by another letters

You: oh I see

Stranger: and in the case of y it must be followed only by a vowel

Stranger: oh man, i wish if i could talk to you by voice to explain to you everything.

You: I think I understand what you mean

You: now with the sound y

You: how you say that?

You: like in "you"?

Stranger: yes

You: okay

Stranger: ya means ya

You: for that we write "j"

You: I mean for this sound

Stranger: it is like zh

You: so for your "y" sound I write "j" - but always that I use

Stranger: yes i see

You: for how english people use it like in "John" I use "Dzs"

Stranger: now we're on the right way

You: but in our own alphabet it has its symbol

Stranger: no

Stranger: not like john

You: every letter one symbol when in our alphabet

You: I know

You: "J" means "y" for us when we say

You: "John" from english we would write as "Dzson"

Stranger: it is just like russian

Stranger: ahha

Stranger: i get it

You: just I added that our own letters

You: in our own old runelike letters we do have a letter for all our sounds

Stranger: by the way three of my aunts are russian

You: just latin had not enough

You: :-)

Stranger: so that's why i'm learning russian, i'm telling you that because you might have noticed I'm mentioning russian very much

You: my girlfriend is Bosnian who live in Norway and I want her to move here so I learn some of that language because of best to honour ones nationality

Stranger: you do have a letter for all sounds, and now do still have that

Stranger: yeah looks great

You: http://pctrs.network.hu/clubpicture/1/7/6/6/_/szekelymagyar__rovasiras_1766419_8224_n.jpg

You: this is our original alphabet - this is only one variant

You: but as I said when we use this one can start a letter 'r' and 'a' simply by mixing the two

You: to spare space

Stranger: nice

Stranger: https://omniglot.com/images/writing/kurdish_haw.gif

Stranger: this is our alphabey

You: what is the C with that thing on it?

Stranger: g

Stranger: or j in john

You: hmmm

Stranger: noooo

Stranger: the normal c is g or j in john

You: hmmm

Stranger: but that c with symbol is ch

Stranger: like in chair

You: that is what is suspected

You: we have letter for that too

You: but the normal "c" is interesting

You: that you write that for the g or j as in john

Stranger: haha yes it really is

You: c is not how english say it for us neither btw

Stranger: then how is it

You: but for me 'c' is something between 't' and 's'

You: not 's' as in "Sure"

You: but in 'ass'

Stranger: so it's s

You: related to it according to the above table I shared somewhere too

You: (S - Sz - Z - Zs) - (Cs - C)

You: but the reason why they make parentheses here is because it is some subgroup

You: but I am not that professor wise man - he would now explain why haha

Stranger: lol

Stranger: but what the pronunciation of that zs

You: like "Journalist"s J when a french man says it

Stranger: and e with a symbol

You: é with a symbol is like first sound of "Alien" for example

You: and without symbol it is like first sound of "exception"

Stranger: yesssss that the J in kurdish finally you got me an example

Stranger: haha

Stranger: maaaan

You: haha

Stranger: without a symbol it is like alien and with a symbol in kurdish it is like exception

Stranger: it is the opposite haha

You: haha

You: i with the sign is just longer i?

Stranger: exactly

You: (i is like in List in mine btw)

Stranger: you knew it haha

You: here too

Stranger: i with the sign is just a longer version

You: we have also the same for o and ó

You: u, ú

You: just longer

You: and i, í

Stranger: we don't have a longer version for o but yes we also have for u

You: also they look similar lettert even in the old runic alphabet

You: oh cool

Stranger: i'm just curious about the order of the sentence in hungarian

Stranger: like the subject, verb, and object

Stranger: which comes after the other

You: when one translate from german or english people are usually told "make it the other way around how they do it"

You: when translating to Hungarian

You: but actually our system is that we can use pretty much any order

Stranger: really

You: some feels better than others though

You: yes

You: Elmentem aranyat mosni.
Mosni mentem aranyat.

You: both means "I went to wash gold"

You: first sentence has extra information that the most relevant event is that I went

You: the second feels the most relevant this is that I wash it

Stranger: yeah we also have sort of this flexibility but it is not very common

You: because Elmentem is "I went to..."

You: yes I do not say we use this all the time

You: songwriters use it all the time though

You: people usually prefer this or that version

You: here they would say "elmentem aranyat mosni" like 90% of cases

You: elmentem is verb here

You: arany is gold

You: mosni verb too

You: (washing)

Stranger: where is the subject

Stranger: who did that work

You: here in middle at the moment

You: oh

You: encoded in the first word here

You: but that is not that usual for all cases

You: "Aranyat mentem mosni"

You: this is more regular

You: "Gold I-went to-wash"

You: suffix of -em means me in this

You: If I say he went that is "Aranyag ment mosni"

You: *aranyat ment mosni

You: so only suffix change there

You: te = he/she/is

Stranger: well

You: in my language there is no he and she

You: separately

You: *sorry te is you

Stranger: this is kinda like what we do in the central dilect

You: "ő is he / she /is"

You: but late haha

You: hmm

Stranger: im suffix and t suffix are also used in that way

You: hmmm

Stranger: but not in my dialect

You: there is reason for this

You: "én" or "ím" means me

You: so ment-ím or ment-én

You: and men = go

You: én = me

Stranger: im literally means me in the sorani dialect or the central dialect

You: interesting

You: ím only means that in very-very old texts

You: we usually now say Én

Stranger: en

Stranger: !!!!

You: but because the big above table

Stranger: in my dialect

Stranger: we say ez

You: they fall into same consonant pronounciation group so is interchangable haha

Stranger: which means me

Stranger: or i

You: you say ez?

Stranger: yes

Stranger: but ez comes only seperately

You: ez means this in my language

You: if your Z sound is like Zoroasters start sound which I suspect haha

Stranger: ez like az in english

Stranger: yes z is the same z in english

You: hmm

You: I can say "e" for the same actually, but "ez" is what we say for "this" like "this thing here" I want to say

You: I just point at it and say "ez"

Stranger: ev means this in my dialect and ama or awa means this or that in the central dialect

You: also implies "here"

You: ev is root of some word in mine

You: when I say "with that"

You: then you can say "evvel" or "avval"

You: however you can say "ama" in very old dialect

You: to how you do

You: exactly in that

Stranger: with that

Stranger: you mean "by"

You: yes

You: sorry contrains of english constrain me to properly say this but it means that too yes

You: "by" too I mean

Stranger: yeah same to me

Stranger: i can't explain efficiently because of english

You: same...

Stranger: i don't know but if you would prefer or be able to...we can make a zoom call some time later when you available.

Stranger: it depends on you... i

Stranger: i'm just saying that because i have a big difficulty to envoy the correct meaning or pronunciation or whatever

You: not later on, because it is like extra late haha. but we can try to continue some way sometime. I understand you say it because pronounciation at least would be easier.

You: sometimes however it is useful not to be able to immediately pronounce - because this way I need to think about it deeply - so it is like a pro-con thing

Stranger: yeah true haha

Stranger: your spirit and brain start to work hard

Stranger: lol

You: yes...

You: how you say tongue btw?

You: or mouth?

Stranger: tongue is

Stranger: ziman

Stranger: and mouth is dev

Stranger: or dav

Stranger: e is just a light a

You: hmmm

You: these I cannot decipher into my language or too late for it to find out

Stranger: haha

You: tongue is "nyelv" here

You: that sound is between n and y

You: in beginning

You: mouth is száj

You: we use same word for language as for tongue

You: hopp

Stranger: yeah i think those are far from each other

You: but for word we use "szó"

Stranger: yeah we also do so haha

You: that might connect a bit to the start of tongue

You: haha

You: then I am more sure in that?

Stranger: ziman is both tongue as a part of body and as language

You: hmmm

You: what is "word"?

Stranger: peyv

You: we have a word peyva

You: but that is some agricultural term

Stranger: it is kinda like payiv

Stranger: for more accuracy

Stranger: wait wait

Stranger: we have peyvandin

Stranger: it is related to agricultue too

You: what does that mean?

Stranger: well i'm not very sure

You: mine is hard for me too haha

Stranger: just a minute i will check

You: We have this saying "elválasztja az árpát és a pelyvát"

Stranger: yes because will don't usually use it is mostly used for villagers

You: to separate barley from "pelyva"

You: ^^this they saying tell

Stranger: i didn't get it %100

You: árpa is barley and pelyva is... well pelyva

You: and we have this saying "elválasztja az árpát a pelyvától" that I know

You: "separate the barley from the 'pelyva'"

You: lookiing up what it means though haha

You: I never did this work I do wine garden but not this

Stranger: i am sure that my parents know it but they are sleeping unfortunately

You: it says it can means a very thin leaf

You: from around the flowering part of something

You: for example

You: when for wheat and barley it means the things that you remove to get the seed itselfves

You: but normal leaf we call "levél"

You: usually this is part that goes away or to animals I think

Stranger: yes we call elef

Stranger: no i

Stranger: no i'm sorry elef is in arabic

You: for the leaf?

You: I think that is also related, but that is very widely related

Stranger: i'm having some kind of difficulty remembering their meanings

You: I see it even in english in that case

You: Leaf - lev-él

Stranger: you mean elef

You: and then in Arabic so likely half the world share that word haha

You: without most of them knowing

You: yes

Stranger: elef mean that thing when they give to animals after harvesting

You: oh

You: hmmm

You: maybe still what I write related to "levél"

Stranger: those agricultural words are very challenging to me

Stranger: can you tell what is snow

Stranger: in hungarian

You: hó

You: interestingly this also means "month"

Stranger: oh wow

You: and moon is "hold"

Stranger: heyv

Stranger: in kurdish means both month and moon

You: hmmm

Stranger: but in the central dialect it is mang

You: that is interesting because mang so completely different from the other

Stranger: in kurdish we have two main dialect they are almost two different language but they are still dialect

Stranger: yes

You: oh

You: btw

You: omg

Stranger: we barely understand from the southern or central kurds

Stranger: we need a translator hahaha

You: I only realized right now that Kurd and Hurri is etymologically same

You: I mean K and H are in same consonant group for us

Stranger: same to guti and then it developed to what it is called now kurd

You: G is same group too

Stranger: really

Stranger: wow

You: cannot explain the T sound appearing though, just the beginning, but for the K-R and H-R I see

Stranger: it is right that guti and hurri are not the same people but they later become one people who are now kurds

You: oh

You: okay I see

You: you seem to kind of fused in the "T" sound from there as your "D" maybe though for the ending

You: but not sure about it

Stranger: yeah i remembered

You: reason I say is that no one will read it from my mind

Stranger: the guti in a next stage they became kurt

Stranger: they were called kurt

Stranger: and the turks until this day they don't say kurd they say kurt

You: I see

You: likely because of this

Stranger: our history is very complicated especially because the turks and persians and arabs will sacrifice their lives just to prevent us from knowing our history

You: at least you are not few people with that population

Stranger: untill now there are ten of cities have not been excavated yet

You: hmmm

Stranger: tens*

Stranger: they refuse to let anyone do so

Stranger: by the way

You: pfff

Stranger: do you know noah

You: yes

Stranger: you know that he has landed on a mountain right.

You: Ararat

Stranger: exactly

Stranger: it is near wan

Stranger: or van

Stranger: and the lake of wan was the very beginning of the first kurds in the north

Stranger: by the way

You: hmmm

You: We actually have our own version of the flood tale separately from the Bible

You: would need to read up what is different from that one in the Book of myths

Stranger: there is the mountain called cudi in kurdish or judi in english we believe that it landed there where the it is in the middle of whole kurdistan

You: oh

You: interesting, so you have other location for it

Stranger: untill this day hundreds and thousands of kurds name their kids judi

Stranger: or cudi in kurdish

You: I think that we have no ship in our variant only the tall mountain or something like so

You: csuda means "wonder" though in my language

You: or "miracle"

Stranger: no in cudi the ship ruins were found

Stranger: that's why we're so sure of it

You: hmm

Stranger: 73002 Dağkonak/Şırnak Merkez/Şırnak, Turkey

Stranger: that is its locatoin

Stranger: look for it

Stranger: it is not very far from ararat

Stranger: but it is in shirnax which a %100 kurdish ancient city

Stranger: are you still on my friend

You: yes

You: was looking map

You: but will soon go

Stranger: ohh alright

Stranger: you haven't seen it yet

You: I only see it on map that there is this lake and one side is ararat and this the other side pretty much

Stranger: did you copy that location correctly

You: I copied it, but not sure I see the right place

Stranger: there is a sign. that red sign referring to the location

Stranger: it is working with me

You: I see Sirnak on the map at least now

You: so likely now I see what I need to

Stranger: maybe it's because of your internet

You: or that I use heavily modded arch linux with a browser that no one else but programmers haha

You: but whatever

Stranger: haha

You: because City is there too I guess now it was good location in the end

Stranger: yes

Stranger: shirnak is only few kilometers away from there

Stranger: you are there

You: how you pronounce that Sirnak?

Stranger: linux

Stranger: shirnx

Stranger: sh in she

You: so the letter "s" with that thingie is like "sh"

You: aha I see

Stranger: yesssss

Stranger: s with symbol is sh

You: for us that is regular "s" letter and "sz" is for the english s like in "toss"

Stranger: aha

You: "tossz"

Stranger: and x

You: yeah how is x?

Stranger: is that letter gernan usually use

Stranger: kh

Stranger: maybe kh

You: aha

You: I think I grasp

You: how you say "order"?

You: and "alliance"?

Stranger: order like what

Stranger: like command

Stranger: or line

Stranger: or queue

You: like in being "orderly" or if good order is in your town

You: or "systematic"

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: we have several ones for that

Stranger: like

Stranger: rez

Stranger: rez e with the sign, like in exchange

Stranger: or

You: hmm

You: we say rend

Stranger: rend

Stranger: !!!!!!!!!!!!

Stranger: is good or well

Stranger: in some cities

Stranger: in kobani and afrin

You: I wanted to say that in your dialect talks above you said "Én, ez, etc so I spot it must be ren(d) too related if rez is

You: but you then use it as rend directly too?

You: for police we say "rendőrség" for example haha

You: "őr" means guard

You: rend is order / rend

You: -ség is like -ness in english

You: like friendly - friendliness

You: barát - barátság

Stranger: ahha

Stranger: what is baray

Stranger: t

You: friend

Stranger: now we have three forms of friend none of them is this

Stranger: lool

Stranger: dost, hawre( e with sign), and haval

You: haver is friend too

You: v pronounces as english w

Stranger: haval is in my dialect hawre is in the central one

You: barát is like deep friend you would be even brave for

You: haver is more like drinking companion friend

You: or more playful

Stranger: yes

You: but it is more depending on situation - not necessarily different person

Stranger: dost is used in both dialect and it means the close friend

Stranger: but the other two are the same as haver

You: hmm

Stranger: https://youtu.be/UFbUp8916_o

Stranger: you can watch this.

You: will surely

Stranger: you will know a lot about the language but not a lot of vocabulary

Stranger: it is in english

Stranger: BTW

Stranger: the sun has risen

Stranger: and I haven't slept yet hahaha

You: me neither

Stranger: cool

Stranger: some common situations lol

You: what flood is btw?

You: and water?

You: as words?

Stranger: Av

Stranger: is water

Stranger: fllood is qel'an or tofan

You: ok, cannot be connections for everywhere :-)

You: flood is ár, árvíz

You: water is "víz"

You: latter also means "it brings", bringing, moving to somewhere

Stranger: viz is very diffirent

You: it also is related to vezet - to lead

Stranger: rebar is leader

Stranger: but i don't know what is to lead or the verb of it lol

Stranger: we have also rebaz renas and rezan

You: ah

Stranger: they all mean leader

You: rezan I understand it is from the same family like the rend

You: like when I say rendező

You: that is director

Stranger: wooooow

Stranger: actually its detailed meaning is the one that shows you the way or the one who directs you to the right way

Stranger: i thought it maybe distant from that meaning

You: it looks to be pretty closely encoded actually

You: into that word

Stranger: re

Stranger: re is way or path

Stranger: zan or nas are completely the same meaning which is who knows

You: I see

Stranger: so re nas or re zan is the one who knows the way

You: -nas ending in my language is mode like ownership - but of a non money thing

You: like ín and inas

You: ok = cause

You: ok-os it is like smart

You: (he knows the causes)

You: he "has" the causes (in his mind)

Stranger: zirak is smark

Stranger: or pahlawan

You: but what is cause?

Stranger: ho

Stranger: i think

You: hm

Stranger: i don't know it from my dialect but in the central one it's ho

You: old judge title was "horka"

You: but btw

You: k-h

You: that is ok

You: just you end with vowel and we start with one

Stranger: yeah

You: does pahlavan more like "wise"? though?

Stranger: exacly

Stranger: the one that can trick you

You: because he van things like "Böl-cs, and Bulcsú" etc

You: I just speculated what it resembles most

You: through the table of rules

You: and P-B-V are in same group

Stranger: ahha

You: h is so tiny that it could got lost

Stranger: v is it like w in kurdish

You: in my language too

Stranger: I see

Stranger: by the way what race do the hungarians belong to

Stranger: sonce there are tones of possible similarities

Stranger: since*

You: we look Caucasian

Stranger: a big part of kurds are also regarded as caucasian

Stranger: in addition to aryan or indo-european

You: Leaders of kings were also many times Taurid in their head forms

You: not sure what that mean, because I am not Anthropoligist

Stranger: alright

Stranger: i'm also not

Stranger: i'm a just a software engineer

You: genetically we were mixed

You: in archeo samples already

Stranger: yeah same to us

You: kings had R1a z2123 subclade

Stranger: i'm not sure what is this

You: but only based on one king who is okay is from Turul dynasty kings

You: but some say graves have been found in interesting circumstances while under Austrian occupation back then

You: so despite it is accepted result

You: I am more conservative and would be happy to know Aba Sámuel grave results too

You: that they excavate only now

You: finally

Stranger: great

Stranger: by the way what does that aba mean

You: Aba is a "nemzetség"

You: hmmm

You: how can I tell...

You: a nation is what we call "nemzet"

You: a tribe we call a "törzs"

You: and we have this smaller things / groups

You: tribes have these "nemzetség" groups too

Stranger: because aba in arabic is son

You: Aba is one of such

Stranger: sorry

Stranger: father

You: father is Apa here

Stranger: apa is father in arabic

Stranger: aba

You: that is same pretty much

You: b-p on my table above

Stranger: one last thing

You: b-p-v-f group

Stranger: whar are your numbers

Stranger: yeah same group

You: we use arab numbers now

You: once we used our own

You: our own was a bit similar to how romans do it, but more logical (lol) and also simpler

You: or the names?

You: omg

You: you likely mean names :D

You: sorry

Stranger: how do you pronounce them

Stranger: lol

Stranger: yes like names

You: egy
kettő
három
négy
öt
hat
hét
nyolc
kilenc
tíz

Stranger: quite different i guess or nut

Stranger: not

You: then
tízenegy
tizenkettő
tizenhárom
....
tizenkilenc
húsz

then

huszonegy
huszonkettő
...huszonkilenc

You: this is actually much more logical than how english people do

Stranger: 1 – yek
2 – du
3 – sê
4 – çar
5 – pênc
6 – şeş
7 – heft
8 – heşt
9 – neh
10 – deh

You: hmm

You: for this one yours sound more indo-europian than ours I think

You: except one

Stranger: which is

You: except 1 and some I wanted to say

You: indo europian is big language family

You: like you say "du" and they say dwa or two here

You: while I say "kettő"

Stranger: our number and persian and pshton or people of Afghanistan are unbelievably the same but we actually are not the same

You: like english people even pronounce "tu" practically after all these times - likely inherit from these forms but here we say differently I feel

You: hmm

Stranger: yeah

You: how is the system for the higher numbers?

You: like 20 and 30 and 40?

You: then just 22 and 44 for example

Stranger: 11 – yanzdeh
12 – dwanzdeh
13 – sêzdeh
14 – çardeh
15 – panzdeh
16 – şanzdeh
17 – hivdeh
18 – hijdeh
19 – nozdeh
20 – bîst
30 – sî
40 – çil
50 – pêncî
60 – şêst
70 – heftê
80 – heştê
90 – nod
100 – sed
1,000 – hezar
one million – milyon

You: hezar we are related though

You: we say "ezer"

You: maybe "sed" we are related though because we say "száz"

You: 1000 - hezar - ezer this surely the same

You: million we also say the same but that might be in my opinion some late addition anyone says the same in world

You: but 100 and 1000 we seem to share but everything smaller we not

You: which is interesting

Stranger: YEAH

You: what about family relations?

You: Brother or sister = testvér
younger brother = öccs
older brother = bátty
younger sister = húg
older system = nővér

You: and does you separate he and she?

You: because we only have "ő" no separate word for he and she we have here
