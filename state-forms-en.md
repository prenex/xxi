Is there any alternatives to democracy and capitalism?

One of my alternatives I can tell - I have more and better, but they are from a multi-authored book so I cannot share the others.

**Have a two-level society:**
* Lvl1: There is no money, everything you get is made by the Lvl1 society as organized work. Everyone has a place to live, work to do and very simple things for life. Food is simple and only contains what the local area can grow, fish, hunt, etc. Of course something more can be got from time to time because there might be some surplus that the Lvl1 society can sell and buy a limited amount of other things or even luxuries. You would say this is a limited, but “perfect” communism?
* Lvl2: Alongside the above, you get a capitalism with money and everything similar to what you have currently. If you lose everything, you just go back to lvl1, otherwise you work only for luxuries, better life, more vacations.
The original idea behind this is to “force” a stable ground base of cement below capitalism that is unaffected by money. This latter is necessary because you cannot expect the capitalist part to upkeep the other part - otherwise it will be really short lived. Without any competition or other possibilities capitalism goes crazy and pull out everything from the small person. This was not done when the soviet union was a threat but now as capitalism is alone, it will be done at least on some levels. The idea is to make the competition happen inside the very same country, so you can never threaten anyone to that level that he follows your orders. Then he will go lvl1 for a time and later might hurt you back.

**Have a good-kingdom:**
I also like the idea of a “kingdom” much better than democracy. I can even see why it is beneficial that the heritage goes through the son and dauther of the king - because in case he fucks up the nation, his sons and grandsons will have a more poor life! It is like making the country state form have the positives of private property you take care of.
This is also the downside sometimes as bad things happen. But people will riot and there is someone who they can riot against - not some hidden figure behind the curtain operating through the media.

BUT! Still this state form can be done in a better way in my opinion, with more chance to have a “good king”. I call this state form “**good-kingdom”:**
* You **vote** for the king/queen if there is none
* You can **vote** to take away the power from him/her
* Anyone who were ever a king or a queen **cannot leave the country ever**** after dethroned**. It is transgession against the law if someone after losing power leaves the country and they are hunted down.
* Anyone who were ever **a king or queen cannot own anything**. When he or she becomes a queen or king his/her family gets all he/she had before and no personal properties will exists aside a very limited amount of necessities like clothes. **This persist after the dethroning too!!!**
* Everyone who is a king or queen is to be living in a **predefined lifestyle** in a quality family house (good quality, possibility for kids, not a broken house etc), a car, free travelling in the country and special defense and protocol flights when an active ruler. He is to wear traditional clothes when applicable. **This persist after the dethroning too!!!**
* If you are dethroned ever, you can be throned still if people want to.
A king or queen surely has a nice and calm life and will not starve, but there is a strict “glass ceiling”. If you really want to live like someone with a lot of money, you just cannot live better this way as you cannot have money, you cannot have any posession, you cannot go through that glass ceiling. You might be hungry for power, but you can not enjoy it more than the definition of what a king has. Also this is not lost after you are dethroned and you need to stay in this condition even after - if your friend have put aside a lot of funds for you you still cannot enjoy that because you need to follow strict customs in your lifestyle. If you ever leave the country after dethroning, secret service agents are to hunt you down - alongside having and international option that in case anyone see you abroad (let they be a peasant or a worker or a minister or anyone) and help to catch you back, they get all your posessions and you continue your life in a jail - as long as people maybe throne you again.

PS.: More in the Hungarian version, with better descriptions on the reasons.
