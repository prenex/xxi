When I speak about “Isten” or “Östen” (our Hungarian word for God) it is already implied we speak about an “Ős-ten”:

* Ős- is a word and word root itself. It both means ancient and ancestor. In the way we use it, kind of get a feeling “ancient old ancestor of every existing thing”
* Ten might be actually the very same word root we use for “ten-ger” (meaning sea), “Dun(a)” (our name for Danube).
* But also related to “tan” which means doctrine, tenet, lore
* Using the rules around consonant groups you get get as far as “Tény” (fact - elementary state) too.
So which interpretations you get?
* őSTeN
    * ancient sea
    * ancient main element of the sea
    * ancestor sea
    * ancestor main element of the sea
* őSDuNa
    * ancient Duna (name)
    * ancestor Duna (name)
    * ancient Danube (river)
    * ancestor Danube (river)
* őSTaN
    * ancient doctrine
    * ancient tenet
    * ancient lore
    * ancestor doctrine
    * ancestor tenet
    * ancestor lore
* őSTéNy
    * ancient fact
    * ancient elementary state
    * ancestor fact
    * ancestor elementary state
* etc.

You can use it in plural in our language but it is illogical to put it plural and you feel it is. Many people are not aware of the deeper meanings of this S-T-N word root semantic connections, but still “feel” it is a single entity - the most ancient entity among everything.
Why I am telling you this story? Because cultural differences and language do count more than you think. In English I am not sure where the word “God” comes from but I would quess it is related to “Good” - see Gott and Gut in German for example! If you imagine God to be representing everything that “Good” represents - a manifestation of “Good” you might also end up with a single entity, but talking about an ancient ancestor of everything might be less misleading and point more into the direction of a single God.

Interesting enough however in Hungarian the STN still has both the good and bad sides to it: SáTáN is the bad and iSTeN is the good. Not even light changes to the consonants - but a different sounding vowel harmony and a difference in the word starting with a consonant or a vowel...
This is the exactly same kind of known duality as with “iGaZ” (true, righteous) and “GaZ” (weed, villain) in Hungarian. Okay... not exactly the same as “iGaZ” can be understood as “éGieS” too.
