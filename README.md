A copy about the book of XXIth century magic

This is a prelimenary version and I would never ever want to show this in public in this current state, but I had to copy it online so that it is still available online if anything bad would happen to the author.

I keep no claims for this work. Hopefully if it gets finished, by its original author maybe this repository could get deleted. I intended not to give out the authors name for this in any ways and not to gain any money neither fame from this work in any ways. Publishing should go by working from the background as it is provided by the original author.

If you share this work, try to keep away from linking to this page directly so that the author can have a way of his choices. Hopefully no one will come here until it is necessary as everything will be in Hungarian anyways - that is the language that can explain these things the best and language structures are used up for the contents too so hopefully there will be no broad interests in this work ;-)

Please read the licence!
