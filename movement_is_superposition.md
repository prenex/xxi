What is with the cat of Schrödinger? Is it **both dead and alive? I disagree.** I think it is “not decided if the cat is dead or alive but the cat is only dead or alive while you are directly look at it - whenever you don’t this property has no meaning anyways”.

Quantum stuff that pulls other people’s hair out is sometimes so easy if you are a programmer. We actually try pretty hard to make things inactive, not existing, not visibly drawn, not having a state whenever a user is not looking at it. This is why walls in games that you are not looking at “right now” are just not there anyways…

PS.: I think actually “movement” is a superposition too. If you shoot an arrow in space what exists in reality? Only the information about the starting point and the curve it goes through… Whenever you look at it at any given time, its shape, look, relevant properties and practically the sense of the arrow can just “start to exist” according to the current time and the start parameters. The parameters only change when it hits something or some force is affecting it. This is not different at all from how the cat is in the Schrödinger example - except that likely the cat is an observer itself so likely it need to exist…
