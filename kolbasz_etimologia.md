The "-basz" in the end is the same as in "baszni" that is to fill something, push into something.

The remaining part, originally is "Kal" and not "Kol". But please keep in mind that in Hungarian the consonants bear the meaning and vowels just change it somewhat, but often are free changable. In some places they still call it "Kalbász" by pronounciation through the country. Also some places just call it "Kóbász" withouot "L" etc.

The "KAL" originally has a world root meaning of "something curvy". It literally is the same world root in "KaL" just like it is in the "CuR-ved". Because the "C" there is pronounced just like the K here (in hungarian we have simple "what you see is how you pronounce" and R-L-Ly-J are same consonant pronounciation group category. So this word is a sister-word both in pronounciation AND meaning to "KöR" aka CiR(cle).
As in the link, see also: kalács, kalán, kalang, kalász, kalap, kaliba, kalimpa, kadisztál, kaloda, kalinkó
or: kaland, kalandor, kalaj, kalaúz, kalézol, kalóz
It also can mean "to collect together" like in the word "kaláka" which is work you do when you collect all your friends and for free work on your things (then they can ask you the same). This kind of "kaláka" is still often happening in Hungary for example.
Also related "KÁL" or "Kül" but further in their meaning... for example in "kül" (like kül-ső, kül-lem or kül-detés, etc." the "circleness" basically gets to mean the outside part of something- the "circumverant area that goes around something etc. ettc.
As I said you can pretty much find out word meanings in Hungarian just by speaking the word. When you speak a word out, in your mind you see many-many words that are related by both pronounciation AND meaning. If you excercise this, it feels like some kind of constant enlightment.
