The book of XXIth century magic

This is a prelimenary version and I would never ever want to show this in public in this current state. What made me put this on github is that I want to have a place where this work resides online accessibly even if anything bad would happen to the author.

I keep no claims for this work. Hopefully if it gets finished, maybe this repository could get deleted. I intended not to give my name for this in any ways and not to gain any money neither fame from this work in any ways. Publishing should go by working from the background.
