In Hungarian language you get “free vocabulary” without learning words. This is common in agglutinative languages.
We never learn “megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért”, but every Hungarian will understand what you mean if you say this very long word.
There are other languages with agglutinative structures though, but even more rare is the sub-word language structure for the base roots of the words! In Hungarian things that sound similar or made with the similar consonant groups (grouped by biologically how you make the sounds) they are indeed similar in meaning.
If I say “drapatás út” and “út” meaning “road”, everyone understands I am talking about a “bumpy road” despite the word “drapatás” or “drapata” is nowhere in any kind of dictionaries and being spoken only in some of the Transylvanian villages where older Hungarian is spoken. It just shows a picture in your mind and you understand it. Just examine what we use for a “piece” like a “piece of ground” or “piece of stone”: we say “darab”. If you really go for the meaning for an unknown word, the first best thing to do after looking if it is constructed via agglutenations is to remove vowels. You get “DaRaB”, or DRB and quess what you get from DRaPa, that seems to be the core root of the unknown “drapatás”? From here on, you can go forward if you understand that P and B are indeed in the same group of consonants when grouped by how you make their sounds and know that to get related meaning analysis you can practically interchange them freely.
Now let us go even deeper with our analysis and see how the part of this word found in an other one is still similar in meaning! If I forget about the ‘D’ sound for a moment at the start (this is quite advanced and I would not advise it generally!) you get (d)RaPaTáS. Let us analyse RPTS and a very similar Hungarian word immediately comes to your mind: “RePeDéS” (crack, breach). I think I do not need to tell you anymore that ‘D’ and ‘T’ is in the same consonant group too! You are already expert in this for the above earlier example didn’t you? :-)
However there is one thing to note about in the connection between (d)RaPaTáS and RePeDéS: I should have only gone as far as to analyse (d)RaPaT vs. RePeD - latter meaning “crack” as a verb and not as the phenomenon that comes after the verb does its job on a surface, because there is a very slight difference in how the ending suffix works and I tell you that you should never really intermix the agglutinative analysis with the word root analysis: generating words roots is much more ancient than using agglutenation to generate further words from other ones. Our language have both of this and this work silently.
Is this how you learn to speak Hungarian? No. Actually many Hungarians can live a life without consciously knowing why these things work, despite they will understand both words like “megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért” and “drapatás”. Think of this as a free aid that randomly just pops up in your mind and you will start wondering: “didn’t I hear something very similar? Wow, maybe this or that means similar?
Look at these:
asztal - table
asztalos - woodworker / tishler
kova - the stone you can use to create fire
kovács - smith
autó - car
szerelő - mechanic
autószerelő - car mechanic
ügy - case
véd - defend
ügyvéd - lawyer
etc.
véd - defend
vitéz - hero, warrior (ViTéZ -> ViTéSz -> VéDéSz meaning those who defend!)
Kör - circle
Király - king (KRLy -> KeRüLy -> KeRüLJ meaning to go around [and defend and define his people])
etc.
Also consider these two words for children: “Kölyök”, “Gyerek”:
K->G->Gy
Ly->L->R
K->K
and you get the very same word - not surprising they mean very-very similar as the way you need to use your mouth, throat etc to pronounce it is similar!
Also even agglutenations go well beyond the level officially being thaught, consider our word for “rain”, called “eső”:
Es, Esik - to fall
ő - he/she/it
Eső - IT THAT FALLS!
Then let us consider some more sacred words for a duality:
(God) Isten -> iSTeN -> STN -> SáTáN (Evil)
Öl = womb <-> Öl = kill
iTT = here <-> oTT = there
éLT = lived <-> (h)aLT = died
Is there a semantic connection? Yes! Surely there is because they are dualities and without one, there is no possibility for the other. Are they the same words? No, as you can see they are different, but they still show this strong duality: If there is Good, there is Bad already existing as the lack of goodness; the womb from which life starts our also starts a ticking clock that will lead to your death; alongside life the lack of it is death…
I will present you one version of the consonant relatedness table I got from my friend who research this stuff on deeper levels of Hungarian grammer - I cannot name him, there has been many attacks in that he uses results from biology and pronounciation that some people actually still around back from commie days did not like. He can only teach these parts as a special collegium at one university.
1. (B - P) - (V - F): "Pff" sound category (A)
2. D - T - Ty: "Bounce" sound category (B)
3. J - R - L - Ly - "Tonguework" sound category
4. (K - H) - (G - Gy) - (Dzs): "Cough" sound category (C)(D) 
5. N - M - Ny: "Adhesive" sound category (or nasal) (E)
6. (S - Sz - Z - Zs) - (Cs - C): "sssss like a wind" voice category (F)
7. X - Y - Q - W: "foreign" symbols (try using the pronounciation)

Also interesting enough in our language there are single-vowel words and actually they use up all possible distinctive characteristics of vowels too.
1.) Vovels are either deep or high pitch:
* Deep [Mé]: a, á, o, ó, u, ú
* High [MA]: i, í, e, é, ö, ő, ü, ű
2.) Also vowels are either long(H) or short[R] (see ‘o’ vs. ‘ó’)
Now look at our one-vowel words:
* Ő: He/she (person, indifferent to place) [MA] [H]
* A: Just ‘a’ like in english (thing, not a person, indifferent to place) [MÉ] [R]
* Ó: Old, far away, sacral (see ókor - classical age, ókeresztény - early christian) [MÉ] [H]
* E: When pointing or referring to something at hand [MA] [R]
Interestingly enough the language used up all the four distinguishable possibilities. Usually though I would say 90% of the semantic meaning of a word is encoded only using the consonants which seems to make sense as they are how we form sounds into meaningful words when starting to speak. Also might be interesting to not that when we are using our own old scythian runic alphabet there is a tendency to only write out the consonants even though this practice is not that practiced nowadays, but it was really useful when carving our own letters in wood in early times. Also if anyone is interested in our Scythian runes too they have one more nice and tricky property that you can use “ligatures” which mean that in case a sign would come after an other, but they share similar properties you can carve or write them together - by adding the distinguishable carving that tells it is not only this or that letter but two letters together. If you understand it easier that way: it is close to drawing or carving both letters on top of each other - except that instead of making it an unreadable mess, you just modify the first letter with properties that surely tells this is two letters in one place.
Its as if you would want to write MK with the usual letters but to save space on the paper you would write an M and two lines of the K letter just from the right side of it. In our runic alphabet you can do this as much until it is not unreadable - it is like a compression of text.
