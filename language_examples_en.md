In Hungarian language you get “free vocabulary” without learning words. This is common in agglutinative languages.
We never learn “megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért”, but every Hungarian will understand what you mean if you say this very long word.
There are other languages with agglutinative structures though, but even more rare is the sub-word language structure for the base roots of the words! In Hungarian things that sound similar or made with the similar consonant groups (grouped by biologically how you make the sounds) they are indeed similar in meaning.
If I say “drapatás út” and “út” meaning “road”, everyone understands I am talking about a “bumpy road” despite the word “drapatás” or “drapata” is nowhere in any kind of dictionaries and being spoken only in some of the Transylvanian villages where older Hungarian is spoken. It just shows a picture in your mind and you understand it. Just examine what we use for a “piece” like a “piece of ground” or “piece of stone”: we say “darab”. If you really go for the meaning for an unknown word, the first best thing to do after looking if it is constructed via agglutenations is to remove vowels. You get “DaRaB”, or DRB and quess what you get from DRaPa, that seems to be the core root of the unknown “drapatás”? From here on, you can go forward if you understand that P and B are indeed in the same group of consonants when grouped by how you make their sounds and know that to get related meaning analysis you can practically interchange them freely.
Now let us go even deeper with our analysis and see how the part of this word found in an other one is still similar in meaning! If I forget about the ‘D’ sound for a moment at the start (this is quite advanced and I would not advise it generally!) you get (d)RaPaTáS. Let us analyse RPTS and a very similar Hungarian word immediately comes to your mind: “RePeDéS” (crack, breach). I think I do not need to tell you anymore that ‘D’ and ‘T’ is in the same consonant group too! You are already expert in this for the above earlier example didn’t you? :-)
However there is one thing to note about in the connection between (d)RaPaTáS and RePeDéS: I should have only gone as far as to analyse (d)RaPaT vs. RePeD - latter meaning “crack” as a verb and not as the phenomenon that comes after the verb does its job on a surface, because there is a very slight difference in how the ending suffix works and I tell you that you should never really intermix the agglutinative analysis with the word root analysis: generating words roots is much more ancient than using agglutenation to generate further words from other ones. Our language have both of this and this work silently.
Is this how you learn to speak Hungarian? No. Actually many Hungarians can live a life without consciously knowing why these things work, despite they will understand both words like “megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért” and “drapatás”. Think of this as a free aid that randomly just pops up in your mind and you will start wondering: “didn’t I hear something very similar? Wow, maybe this or that means similar?
Look at these:
asztal - table
asztalos - woodworker / tishler
kova - the stone you can use to create fire
kovács - smith
autó - car
szerelő - mechanic
autószerelő - car mechanic
ügy - case
véd - defend
ügyvéd - lawyer
etc.
véd - defend
vitéz - hero, warrior (ViTéZ -> ViTéSz -> VéDéSz meaning those who defend!)
Kör - circle
Király - king (KRLy -> KeRüLy -> KeRüLJ meaning to go around [and defend and define his people])
etc.
Also consider these two words for children: “Kölyök”, “Gyerek”:
K->G->Gy
Ly->L->R
K->K
and you get the very same word - not surprising they mean very-very similar as the way you need to use your mouth, throat etc to pronounce it is similar!
Also even agglutenations go well beyond the level officially being thaught, consider our word for “rain”, called “eső”:
Es, Esik - to fall
ő - he/she/it
Eső - IT THAT FALLS!
Then let us consider some more sacred words for a duality:
(God) Isten -> iSTeN -> STN -> SáTáN (Evil)
Öl = womb <-> Öl = kill
iTT = here <-> oTT = there
éLT = lived <-> (h)aLT = died
Is there a semantic connection? Yes! Surely there is because they are dualities and without one, there is no possibility for the other. Are they the same words? No, as you can see they are different, but they still show this strong duality: If there is Good, there is Bad already existing as the lack of goodness; the womb from which life starts our also starts a ticking clock that will lead to your death; alongside life the lack of it is death…
I will present you one version of the consonant relatedness table I got from my friend who research this stuff on deeper levels of Hungarian grammer - I cannot name him, there has been many attacks in that he uses results from biology and pronounciation that some people actually still around back from commie days did not like. He can only teach these parts as a special collegium at one university.
1. (B - P) - (V - F): "Pff" sound category (A)
2. D - T - Ty: "Bounce" sound category (B)
3. J - R - L - Ly - "Tonguework" sound category
4. (K - H) - (G - Gy) - (Dzs): "Cough" sound category (C)(D) 
5. N - M - Ny: "Adhesive" sound category (or nasal) (E)
6. (S - Sz - Z - Zs) - (Cs - C): "sssss like a wind" voice category (F)
7. X - Y - Q - W: "foreign" symbols (try using the pronounciation)

Also interesting enough in our language there are single-vowel words and actually they use up all possible distinctive characteristics of vowels too.
1.) Vovels are either deep or high pitch:
* Deep [Mé]: a, á, o, ó, u, ú
* High [MA]: i, í, e, é, ö, ő, ü, ű
2.) Also vowels are either long(H) or short[R] (see ‘o’ vs. ‘ó’)
Now look at our one-vowel words:
* Ő: He/she (person, indifferent to place) [MA] [H]
* A: Just ‘a’ like in english (thing, not a person, indifferent to place) [MÉ] [R]
* Ó: Old, far away, sacral (see ókor - classical age, ókeresztény - early christian) [MÉ] [H]
* E: When pointing or referring to something at hand [MA] [R]
Interestingly enough the language used up all the four distinguishable possibilities. Usually though I would say 90% of the semantic meaning of a word is encoded only using the consonants which seems to make sense as they are how we form sounds into meaningful words when starting to speak. Also might be interesting to not that when we are using our own old scythian runic alphabet there is a tendency to only write out the consonants even though this practice is not that practiced nowadays, but it was really useful when carving our own letters in wood in early times. Also if anyone is interested in our Scythian runes too they have one more nice and tricky property that you can use “ligatures” which mean that in case a sign would come after an other, but they share similar properties you can carve or write them together - by adding the distinguishable carving that tells it is not only this or that letter but two letters together. If you understand it easier that way: it is close to drawing or carving both letters on top of each other - except that instead of making it an unreadable mess, you just modify the first letter with properties that surely tells this is two letters in one place.
Its as if you would want to write MK with the usual letters but to save space on the paper you would write an M and two lines of the K letter just from the right side of it. In our runic alphabet you can do this as much until it is not unreadable - it is like a compression of text.

About the Hungarian Language
What many dismiss who is not of Hungarian origin is the deep logic in the way a Hungarian person can create word roots. Practically everyone knows that Hungarian words can be created by putting together already existing words and combining their meaning and adding suffixes or prefixes to them in practically any numbers. This way we get a graph or a tree in which we have words that are similar both in how they sound and what they mean.
This is well known, but there is a lesser known, similarity that non-Hungarian people rarely find. It is that 
in Hungarian, a word root usually means something similar, if it sound similar.
Maybe you think this is a small property of a language but it is not. This literally let us to understand words we have never heard and learned, just by thinking about to which others words they are similar to, and what is the underlying logic. Also very short words sometimes mean whole sentences. One more specialty is that in the language there are no grammatic female and male forms - you just speak and it does not count who made a work or something like that. Also the order of words is usually not strict at all in the sentence. I can say the sentence nearly in every order - except the case there is a word that directly refers to the one after or before it. Of course you can only move that together with the referred to word. The rules in Hungarian are not rules you need to follow strictly, they are rules that seem as if someone made them to be easily followed by logical thinking. Even if you find irregularities, you can feel a logical explanation to them in most cases. Do not fear to just start talking if you are still a beginner. Because of the freedom in the language, you will be most likely not only understood, but will not sound completely bad anyways.
Okay, but how this similarity works between the words? First you need to understand that vowels serve mostly for emotions and to aid pronounciation. In Hungarian we do not like to mix high pitch and low pitch vowels and we do not like to have words in which too many consonants are after each other. The language prefers easy and proper pronounciation. This is also helped by literally pronouncing the words as they are written letter-by-letter (unlike many languages). So vowels are mostly only there for emotional load and for harmony, but the core meaning is in the consonants - except very few cases.
If I want to understand what a word mean and what related words I can find, the first thing I do in my mind is to concentrate on the consonants. If doing an analysis like this in writing, then the first thing that I do is to strip away the vowels - or at least write all the consonants in big capitals.
Look at these words:
CsaP: tap
CsePp: drop (of water)
In english these two words are mostly only related by meaning it, but here they are basically the same word - just one with a high pitch vowel and a longer ‘p’ in the end.
CsePp >> Cs-Pp >> Cs-P >> CsaP
They sound pretty close too and you can literally “feel” they are related. When I change a double-consonant into a simple one or the other way around I basically only change the length of it, so that does not count as a strong phonetic change and didn’t change the semantic linkage on the meaning. Practically you can change vowels as you wish in most of the cases, but there is of course no way to just randomly change the consonants.
There is a structured way though, seen in the following table:
(B - P) - (V - F): "Pff" sound category (A)
D - T - Ty: "Bounce" sound category (B)
J - R - L - Ly - "Tonguework" sound category
(K - H) - (G - Gy) - (Dzs): "Cough" sound category (C)(D)
N - M - Ny: "Adhesive" sound category (or nasal) (E)
(S - Sz - Z - Zs) - (Cs - C): "sssss like a wind" voice category (F)
X - Y - Q - W: "foreign" symbols (try using the pronounciation)
These are consonant pronounciation groups. I have taken this from my friends work who studies language. I can never ever show his name, because his lead professor is quite a commie and dislikes whenever he talks about these outside proper papers so I will not name him and will not make these informations correspond to him in any ways that might hinder his carrier. But I want to mention, that these kind of things were already researched a lot before Austrian and later Soviet rule in Hungary and the old tracks are renewed and further researched only lately.
So what is this table about? They tell you the consonants that you can change in a Hungarian word, while the core meaning in some way will be still kept in the new word.
Moving further with the above example (CsePp) we can for example make a word by changing the ‘Cs’ (sounds “tsch” in German) into an “S” sound which is in the same consonant group. This way you get to the word “SeP” which does not exists. Now look at the ‘P’ and change it accordingly to the table above to be a ‘B’ sound: what you get is “SeB”. This word do exist and you of course “feel” how close it sounds. But what it means? SeB = wound.
What you can conclude from this? Basically you can see that a wound is dropping away your blood from your body. Your wound makes “blood drops” (vércseppek) and it acts as a tap on your blood circulation system that lets it flow out of your body. Is it the same word as the other two? Not! But is it closely related both by meaning and by pronounciation? Yes it is!
After you start to excercise this kind of thinking in the logic of the language after you already speak Hungarian, you will be constantly mesmerized. It will feel as if your language speaks to you and it is a living entity that can tell you what is a deeper meaning of the words and sentences. You can ask questions like “what is life” and you will get an answer what it is according to the logic of the language. You can ask what is the meaning of it, and if you pay enough attention you will get an answer what it is according to the language (I wrote about these elsewhere and I didn’t want to ruin anyone trying to find this out). This is not an ability that every Hungarian do. Those who taught not to think like this, might just follow the word meaning as it is in the dictionary, but even them can learn how this works if they pay attention. This is the hardest for those who have learnt foreign languages too early - I mean languages where this logic is practically non-exisitent :-(
Just to give an example: some days ago I have found myself accused that I am talking “globally” about a whole group of things while I said “approx. every” which is “kb. minden” in my language. The guy ignored that word but it of course meant that I know about counter-examples of course. Then just out of interest it hit me in the head what “kb” (short for “körülbelül”) means. Kör is circle, Kert is garden, kerités is fence. The start of the word of körülbelül means that we mean a circular shape or an enclosed area. “belül” means “inside”. What this whole word means is that we are not talking about an accurate value, but we talk about a “circle” or “enclosed area” near a value that we say and the real value is someone “inside” of this circle or enclosed area! This is purely what mathematicians would define the phenomena, but our language already “says it so secretly”.
Just to give one more meaningful example: Let us analyze the world “God”.
God = Isten = ISTeN = STN = ŐSTeN
 (some say it like this)
The word “őS” means ancient or ancestor. When being there alone it kind of feels “THE ancestor (of everything)”. What is TeN? This is a root consonant combination in many of our words. Like in “TeNGeR” (sea / a huge amount or quantity) and in “Teng(-leng)”, “Ténfereg”(just being without a purpose, just 
being all around 
without any earlier direct cause
). Also there is the word “TaN” which means doctrine, know(-ledge), path of life. Usually what I would translate as “TaN” is for example a whole school of thinking - like a religious doctrine or at least a martial arts doctrine that is really strict or something ancient and very clear about what it says and why. Also there is the word “tengely” which means “axis” (usually one that always moves, turns or waves around). Also there are old words like “téns” (grandpa-like talking in villages) which means “Honorable” and it feels to me that this word is also because of the huge amount of quantity. Also there is this word “tente” which we say to a child to sleep in peace. You must understand that “te” alone means “you”. Basically in this latter case we want to “nestle” or wave a kid as if you lay on the sea on a boat in peace.
What we get by just asking the language logic about this word of God is that:
It is the first in existence and it is the ancient being
that is ancestor of everything
and were/is all around without any earlier direct cause
and is honourable
and huge / great like the sea
and is as peaceful that you say it to your children to go there.
One good rule to keep in mind is however to not cross this lower level of word construction into the territory where suffixes and prefixes are. This is the more ancient layer in most cases and you get only false positives most of the time if you start to apply these to the inflections and when you put together more words. Think of these as a way to make new core word-bases or to follow their meanings - but even after that, you can create new words on a higher level construction too using inflexions and union of words by putting them together to form a new one. Using both structures you can get graphs in which both there is semantic and phonetic / language similarity between the words. Really huge graphs or a “web” of meaning. This is why you can feel your language talks to you if you ask him questions about life.
Also worth meaning a small detail in our Chronicles. It has a different version of the Tower of the Babel story than you can find in the Bible, but if you put them together you get a story without holes. It is as if someone wrote down an other version from the similar story with other details being emphasized and from an other viewpoint. In this chronicle they say that “when Nimród have seen the one language of humanity starts to confuse he left Bábel with his people and went to Ninive”. In that place he have fathered “Hunor and Magyar” with other sons and daughters who speak similar language than these two but stayed in place, while Hunor and Magyar went to follow the wonderstag and ended up in the land of Meotis. LAter with Szépmező Szárnya every descendant of them tried to keep the Carpathian basin as the “last golden corner” of the world which translates to the “last place still peaceful and normal until the world ends”
Please take care as there is a very minor detail encoded in here! According to the text, Nimród did not wait until the languages “got confused”, but left at the very start of this process with his people. This line very highly hint that the person who wrote that has had the tradition even in the medieval times that the language in question have survived the confusion of the languages - or at least all the effort was made to save it from that.
Purely a speculation, but a confusion like that can happen easily if you hve a system with which you can create words along phonetic similarities, but slowly forget the system and just use the words as if you learn by a dictionary. This way those parts of a bigger empire or group who do not communicate will slowly develop different words using the same system and if they forget the system there will be no way any more for them to understand each other as they only have parts of the original construction kit. This latter part is my speculation only.
