Genetics are there to see population movements and have cleaner picture on that.

Language gets preserved in multiple ways. Like name “Atilla” is relative of “Etele” (see “Etelköz” area how we name the pre-9th-century-conquest area - meaning in-between-rivers) or the term we use for drinkable fluid: “ital”.

Really first Hungarian text is in Ammianus Marcellinus RERVM GESTARVM LIBBRI QVI SVPERSVNT:

“Visoque imperatore ex alto suggestu iam scrmonem parante lenissimum meditanteque allgoqui uelut morigeros iam futuros quidam ex illis furore percitus truci calceo suo in tribunal contorto marha, marha", quod est apud eos signum bellicum, exclamauit eumque secuta incondita multitudo uexillo elato repente barbarico ululans ferum in ipsum primcipem ferebatur, qui cum ex alto despiciens plena omnia discurrentis turbae cum missilibus uidisset retectisque gladiis et uerrutis, iam propinquante pernicie externis mixtus et suis ignotusque."”

But “marha” is not “signum bellicum” like the Roman army thought, but a word for cattle that can be used as a derogatory term in Hungarian haha. Still to this day can be said to polititians just like in the above case. This have happened in Pannonia, actually earlier than Atilla so more in line with the Tárih-i Üngürüsz chronicle version.

Other example is “Borysthenes” who were greeks of the north-black-sea but this term for them was coined by local Scythians. We know why they are called like that: Because they serve Dionüssos as a God and that is why Scyths named them such. Now… Interestingly “Bor” means “wine” and “Isten” is “God”. If you want to say that someone has deity for wine and laugh them out, you can say still to this day that “Boristenes!” ;-)

An other example is when Herodot mentions “feathers” are everywhere North from the most North Scyth lands so they do not pass there neither anyone dare to they say for feathers fall all-day. Off course anyone with common sense can see that these feathers are snow. But in Hungarian there is a connection between a feather and a falling snow: “hópehely” (for snow), “tollpehely”(for feather). One can even just say “nagy pelyhekben hullik” or “nagy pelyhekben esik” if they want. Pehely is related to “pihe” which kind of means a lightweight something that slowly descends. Likely the translator Herodot used (who did met Scyths) met the feather kind of translation much more easier than the snow kind of because this does not appear when one is just talking about snow, except if one is talking about the falling element… Also when describing Persians campaigns against Scyth lands they clearly battle around the “Ister” river and Pannonia if one follows the description. That is danube and Hungary - and the story is earlier than the case of “marha-marha” shouting against romans who came to pannonia.

Going back to the chronicles (This time the Thúróczi one):

“Khús nemzette Nimródot. Ez volt az a Nimród, aki Noé utódait rávette az Úr elleni lázadásában ama híres torony és város építésére. A hagyomány azt tartja, hogy e torony építése Núbia és Egyiptom határán történt, mások viszont azt mondják, hogy Káldeában az Eufrátesz folyó mellett volt némelyek úgy tartják, hogy ez a Nimród volt a hunok, vagyis a magyarok ősapja. Nimród, az óriás a nyelvek összezavarodása után Havilah földjére költözött, amit most Perzsiának neveznek, és itt két fiat nemzett Enéh nevű feleségének, az egyiket Hunornak, a másikat pedig Magornak nevezték: végül is az összes hunok, vagyis a magyarok ezektől vették eredetüket.

Azt is mondják, hogy ugyanennek a Nimródnak más feleségei is voltak, és más fiakat is nemzett, és hogy ezek és utódaik Perzsiában laknak, testalkatuk és színük hasonlít a hunokéra, csupán beszédük különbözik tőlük valamelyest, ahogy a szászoké a türingiaikétól.”

In this case the highlighted text first relates Huns and Magyars, then however talks about farther-away relatives who still live in Persia, their looks and colors are like the Huns, but their speech is a bit different - as Saxon speech is different from Thüringer.

^^Given this and that he is talking about further-away cultures from Huns than Hungarians, the chronicle traditions clearly state that Huns and Hungarians speak some kind of same language variety otherwise they would say something like this. It is quite clear when one read it that this is practically sure here. That is when they talk about Székelys as those who remains from Huns, they tell they speak the same language - just like the other version of the text which is not direct translation of the Thúróczi version however, but based on some common earlier source. This is clear from differences and same parts. Also is interesting how long this other related-speaking people were existing or not…..

An interesting thing about our language that we actually call Italian people “Olasz”. I am not sure if you know this, but this is also related to Oláh, Vlach, Blak, Blach in a way in the Hungarian way of saying the nationality name the two are of course clear close as Oláh and Olasz just has different suffix… Actually the first word root in “LAtin”, just the start might also refer somehow to the same. “Vlach-tin” ~ La-tin. like as in “Rutén”, “Rusin” etc… It might refer to Eastern Franks short occupation as much as anything more related to Balkanic-area latin populations and anything else.

And now we end up at an interesting phenomenom. Many claim Troy was where latins came from into Italy and slowly won supremacy over Etruscians and so. Also claimed that Sicambria was a temporarily existing city of them looking for refuge and those of Sicambria and running in this direction later ended up founding Paris (named after the Troyan Páris - it does not count there was also a tribe for it that even more corresponds the story). So many tales so far, but these are also usually part of the Chronicles on our side many times which might be weird for many, but I see why they are mentioned in our books. Now lets look in what other way Troy is called too: “Ilium” see that “L” in the beginning which we saw so many times in the word root?

I am sure the last part will look blasphemy or chaos to the untrained eye, but it is well after midnight and wanted to write down what I spot now by just using my language tricks - have no time for a cleanup now as I feel I will just forget it. As a Hungarian we are used to the fact that consonants are main conveyors of meaning in a word and how words are a world themselves and get formed because we still do word creation everyday on multiple levels. Some of the rules we use can be spotted in other places too and apply there too easily to get a better understanding. So for the latter little theory all I did was to spot how word-roots are in the name, what remains the same and what differs and spot possible links.
